# Connectors

A `connector` is the interface between the `hint`s and the website
you are testing. It is responsible for loading the website and exposing
all the information to `webhint` such as resources, network data, etc.

To configure a connector you need to update your `.hintrc` file to
make it look like the following:

```json
{
    "connector": {
        "name": "connectorName"
    }
}
```

Where `connectorName` is the name of the connector.

## Built-in connectors and platform support

All the built-in `connector`s run in any of the supported platforms:
Linux, macOS, and Windows. The only caveat is that, for the `connector`
that you specify in the`.hintrc` file, you will need to have the
browser the `connector` is for installed as `webhint` will not
install it for you.

The current supported connectors are:

* `jsdom`: Your website will be loaded using [`jsdom`][jsdom].
* `chrome`: Your website will be loaded using Chrome and the Chrome
  Debugging Protocol. This is one of the `remote-debugging-connector`s.
* `local`: This connector will analyze the files specified (a file
  or a directory).

**Note:** If you are running Windows 10 [build 14951][wsl-interop] (or
later) and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), `webhint` will be capable
of running the browsers installed directly on Windows. If you are a
user of the stable release of Window, you will need to use at least the
*Fall Creators Update*.

## Configuration

`connector`s can be configured. Maybe you want to do a request with
another `userAgent`, change some of the other defaults, etc. For that,
you have to add the property `options` to your `connector` property
with the values you want to modify:

```json
"connector": {
    "name": "connectorName",
    "options": {}
}
```

The following is the list of shared configurations for all `connector`s:

* `waitFor` time in milliseconds the connector will wait after the site is
  ready before starting the DOM traversing and stop listening to any
  network request. By default, it will wait until the network is somehow
  "quiet" even though more requests could be processed after DOM traversing.

Depending on the `connector`, other configurations may be available.

### jsdom configuration

`jsdom` allows you to configure the following:

* `headers`: the headers used to fetch the resources. By default they are:

```json
 {
    "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.8,es;q=0.6,fr;q=0.4",
    "Cache-Control": "no-cache",
    "DNT": 1,
    "Pragma": "no-cache",
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/68.0.3440.106 Safari/537.36"
}
```

### remote-debugging-connector configuration

There are some `connector`s built on top of the [Chrome DevTools
Protocol][cdp]. `chrome` and `edge` are some of these `connector`s.

The set of settings specific for them are:

* `defaultProfile (boolean)`: Indicates if the browser should use the
  default profile or create a new one. By default the value is `false`
  so a new one is created. You might want to set it to `true` if you
  want `webhint` to have access to pages where the default profile is
  already authenticated. This only applies for Google Chrome as
  Microsoft Edge doesn’t create a new profile.
* `useTabUrl (boolean)`: Indicates if the browser should navigate first
  to a given page before going to the final target. `false` by default.
* `tabUrl (string)`: The URL to visit before the final target in case
  `useTabUrl` is `true`. `https://empty.webhint.io/` is the
  default value.
* `flags? (string[])`: Allows you to pass in additional Chrome
  command line API flags. Useful if you would like to start your
  session in headless mode or with GPU disabled. Here's the full list
  of [available command line flags][cli flags].
* `waitForContentLoaded (number)`: Time in milliseconds to wait for the
  `loadingFinished` event from the `debugging protocol` before requesting
  the body of a response. The default value is `10000` (10 seconds).

```json
{
    "defaultProfile": true,
    "flags": ["--headless", "--disable-gpu"],
    "tabUrl": "https://empty.webhint.io/",
    "useTabUrl": false,
    "waitForContentLoaded": 10000
}
```

### local configuration

 `local` allows you to configure the following:

* `pattern`: Add or ignore files defined in the pattern. By default the
  `local` connector will use the following patter `['**', '!.git/**']`. This
  doesn't apply if you are targeting just a file or if you are using the
  options `content`.
* `watch`: Run `webhint` in watch mode. Watch files and trigger the analysis
  on changes.

```json
{
  "pattern": ["**", "!.git/**"],
  "watch": false
}
```

In addition, the `local` connector accept a new parameter in the
method `collect` that allow you to pass the content to analyze as an string.
To use that property, you need to call to the `executeOn` method in
the engine with the content to analyze.

```js
engine.executeOn(url, {content: '{{your content}}'});
```

## Differences among connectors

Connectors are expected to implement at least some basic functionality
(see [how to develop a connector][how to connector])
but expose more events or have some extra functionality. The following
document details the known differences or issues among the official
connectors.

### Edge

* You need administrator privileges to run `webhint` on Edge. You
  should be automatically prompted when running it.
* It’s best to close all instances of Edge before to avoid any issues.
* The current implementation can have some problems when scanning multiple
  sites simultaneously. This should not be a common scenario.
* The connector will make use of the `useTabUrl` and `tabUrl` properties.
  Removing those can cause unexpected results.

### jsdom

* It will not send the events for:

  * `element::#document`
  * `element::#comment`
